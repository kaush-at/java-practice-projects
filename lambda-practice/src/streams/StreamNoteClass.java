	 * streams make heavy use of lambda expression
	 * 
	 * streams is a pipeline that consist of a source and a few operations and then finally a terminal operation
	 * therefore there are 3 components to a streams.
	 * 		1.Source
	 *  	2.intermediate operations - ex/filter(),sort(),map(),distinct(),skip(),sorted() (we can chain multiple intermediate operations together)
	 *  	3.terminal operation  - can return void or a non-stream (result such a list or a single value)
	 * 	  EXAMPLE IMAGE - see the Streams.png 
	 * 	
	 * --intermediate operations--	
	 *   we can have zero or more intermediate operations are allowed (you can go directly from source to terminal operation/ it is not must
	 *   	to have intermediate operations)
